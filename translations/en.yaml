    Hi! Lets get me setup for use in this Discord. The steps are outlined below, but for a detailed setup guide, visit https://nilesbot.com/start
    1. Invite `niles-291@niles-169605.iam.gserviceaccount.com` to 'Make changes to events' under the Permission Settings on the Google Calendar you want to use with Niles
    2. Enter the Calendar ID of the calendar to Discord using the `!id` command, i.e. `!id 123abc@123abc.com`
    3. Enter the timezone you want to use in Discord with the `!tz` command, i.e. i.e. `!tz America/New_York` or `!tz UTC+4` or `!tz EST` No spaces in formatting.
    
    Niles should now be able to sync with your Google calendar and interact with on you on Discord, try `!display` to get started!";

no_cal: |-
  I can't seem to find your calendar! This is usually because you haven't invited Niles to access your calendar, run `!setup` to make sure you followed Step 1.
  You should also check that you have entered the correct calendar id using `!id`.
