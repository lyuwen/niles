# Niles v5 aka Typescript Rewrite

src - commands/ utils ported over to TS + Slash Commands

src-js - old JS commands renamed to .ts

CHANGELOG.md - finally a proper changelog

this builds on a very weird TypeScript + Discord.js base that I built out of confusion so YMMV

This build does not work and is the best baseline for a TS rewrite
